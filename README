Bare metal code for MIPS cpus, more specifically for the
ci20 creator board.

The code focus on interrupt & exceptions handling and, hopefully,
 simplicity and clarity.


Remarks:
- the build system was heavily inspired by Linux's kbuild
  but it also quite different (non-recursive make) and
  much less sophisticated.

/*********************************************************/
To compile & link, a plain
	> make
will compile all the source code into a library: libtarget.a
	> make dir/
will only compile the source in the given directory,
	> make dir/file.o
will only compile the given file.
	> make apps/
will compile and link the few examples presents there. 


Have fun.
